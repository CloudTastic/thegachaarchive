Hello peeps of the internet! This is "The Gacha Archive", a website where you can come to download things from <b>Gacha Life</b>, <b>Gacha Club</b>, and <b>Gacha Life 2</b>.
<br>
In the Gacha Life 2 section there is all of the static poses
<br>
When you want the backgrounds, assets, props, etc. just press the button and it will download them all, sorted by game.
<br><br>
Some of the assets, props, foregrounds, etc. will be traced by yours truely, so they may be a bit... strange, the lines could be wonkey.
<br>

When you want a pose you click on the box the pose is in and it will copy to your clipboard. 
<br> 
When you want an asset, prop, etc. you will also click on the same button, but it will download as a PSD, which you can use in "Photopea" 
to view, or just import into Ibis Paint.
<br>
When you want a background just click on the picture and it will download normally to your device.
<br><br>

Everything are a WIP, so some things don't work!
